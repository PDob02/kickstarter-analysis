# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project is to find out information pertinent to Louise's the playwright's Kickstarter goal. She is primarily interested in the outcomes based on launch date measured by month & outcome based on goal or number of dollars requested for each campaign. We analyzed over 4,000 data sets dating back to 2015 with plays, successful, failed, & canceled as some of our qualitative measures based on underlying data. With the help of our previous data analysis, Louise launched a successful play called "Fever" that came close to their fundraising goal in a few short months.

### Purpose
This project is to find out information pertinent to Louse's the playwright's Kickstarter goal. She is primarily interested in the outcomes based on launch date. In other words, our analysis answers the question of "What is the best month or season to launch a campaign?" The second measure is success based on goal amount. We analyzed over 4,000 data sets dating back to 2015. 


## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on our analysis May was the best month to launch a project. This was followed by a similar yet not as prominent spike in June & July. April & August showed similar trends for success. Towards the end of the year, October, November & December, showed the least amount of success with October being the worst of the months for failure based on volume. December came in last for number of successful plays almost matched the number of failures. In other words, a December launch was close to a 50/50 chance of success or failure.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Another interesting piece of analysis that Louise tasked us with exploring is the Outcomes based on goals. The goal is defined as the funds requested before the Kickstarter project launches. This was a measure against the amount pledged. Based on the data some of the most successful campaigns took place at under $1000 to $5000. There was also a jump in success between 35,000 to 45,000 with sharply declining returns after that sans an outlier of two successful campaigns greater than 50,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the difficulties encountered included an incomplete data set. We can always use more information to get more granular reporting. Also, there is room for human error as these excel workbooks are very large and can be corrupted or errors can be made when moving and filtering data. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion that I can draw about the outcomes based on launch data is that the month of May is not only the most successful but also the most popular month to launch this sort of project. This is the top of our bell curve. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
We can conclude based on goals that either a small goal i.e. under $5,000 or a medium to large goal of $35000 to $45,000 are the two best intervals to launch a campaign. This can be due to many circumstances or the type of content that is being pitched. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations of this dataset include where it was launched, the relevancy of campaigns in different countries, and the date of the data. Most of this data is from 2017 or earlier.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could created other graphs based on the genre of material presented in the data. This could be done by further finding out if the theater material was sci fi, fantasy, comedies, musicals, biographical etc. Also, since success is generally found under $1000 there is an argument to be made that small fundraising goals could be explored further. Finally, we could track the duration of the campaign and what years were most successful.
